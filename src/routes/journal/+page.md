##### Objectives

The proposed journal seeks to mainstream Indian conceptual vocabulary in various disciplines and interdisciplinary areas to understand Indian experience. It will provide a forum to scholars who wish to study India, its civilizational journey in various aspects of human endeavor, its people and its experience using Indian texts and contexts as media of knowledge production. The objectives are two-fold: first, it will cover an interrogative track highlighting the universalizing claims of current Oriental / auto-Oriental scholarship and its project of producing India as object of knowledge. Second, it will have a constructive track of finding alternative theories and conceptual frameworks that emerged in India, and their implications in various dimensions for now and the future. This will, in addition to all other relevant strands, involve sustained engagement with all Vidyas and Kalas and will include Indian philosophical and cognitive sciences, psychological, social & cultural sciences, political & economic sciences, performing arts & aesthetics, science & technology, law, public policy & governance among others.

The broad domains include the following:

- Indian art and aesthetics, including performing arts
- Indian psychology
- Itihasa, Purana
- Nyaya, Pramana, Tarka and Vada
- Indian sociology and cultural studies
- Urban studies and architecture
- Colonial discourse analysis, Decolonial studies and theory
- Modern cultural and social thought
- Vedic, Buddhist,Jain, Sikh and other knowledge traditions that originated in India
- Indian statecraft, law, policy, public administration
- Educational & pedagogical traditions of India
- Indian health & wellness sciences
- Indian mathematics, sciences, engineering & technology
- Other relevant areas to further the objectives of the journal

The journal is envisaged to have bi-annual issues with articles submitted in English. The target is to launch the journal by March/April, 2025 subject to alignment of some other factors beyond the control of the publishing and planning team. A reputed international commercial publisher will be our publication partner. The link to the journal page with all relevant details (hosted by the publisher) will be shared here soon.
