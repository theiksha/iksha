                <p>Today there is a greater awareness about the significance of Indian traditions in solving human problems. There is an increased interest globally in engaging with and reflecting on Indian knowledge systems as an important part of global knowledge systems. In India, the knowledge produced by Indians over millennia has gained the attention of scholars for the past 5 decades under different names. <br><br> Indian knowledge systems (IKS) has become an umbrella term to engage and formulate questions about the world and human beings. The IKS and Heritage Association has recently initiated a long-term program to support and nurture the young generation scholars who are interested in various domains of IKS. We call this program DIIKSHA (Doctoral Initiative of IKS and Heritage Association).</p>

                <h4 class="text-title" style="color: black;">A Proposal for Developing Scholars to Articulate, Teach, and Transmit Indian Knowledge Systems</h3>
                <p>The current perception of the Indian higher education system, as depicted in both popular and academic literature, is marked by terms such as “decline,” “disarray,” and “crisis.” This proposal aims to address the existing challenges, particularly in the realm of humanities, social sciences and issues concerning Indian civilization by fostering a new generation of scholars capable of articulating, teaching, and transmitting Indian Knowledge System effectively.</p>
                <h4 class="text-title" style="color: black;">Study of Indian Knowledge System today and its Challenges</h4>
                <p>The Vaidyanathan Report and the Fourth Review Committee Report on the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) bring attention to the inadequate quality of social science research and the dismal state of higher education institutions in general. Despite an increase in social science research, the quality of output and its contribution to understanding socio-economic processes are considered insufficient. The current discourse in humanities, social sciences, and discussions about Indian civilization often perpetuates Orientalist descriptions. There has been little progress in transitioning from the reproduction of European cultural experiences to a scientifically reflective examination of the Indian experience. The expansive domain of the Indian Knowledge System is currently labeled as a form of heritage or nationalistic sentiment, lacking significance or relevance. Furthermore, it is alleged to be treated as something regressive and contrary to progress.</p>
                <h4 class="text-title" style="color: black;">Proposed Institutional Framework</h4>
                <p>To overcome these challenges, a new institutional space is proposed, focusing on India with emphasis on Indian Knowledge System (IKS) (or any other name deemed appropriate). This initiative seeks to incubate young intellectual minds within selected institutions, fostering a scientific approach to the study of Indian civilization that aligns with Adhyatma.</p> -->
