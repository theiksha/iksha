      <h1>About the Conference</h1>
      <div class="about-container">
        <div class="column"> <h2>Understanding the Legacy and Challenges of Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)</h2> <p>Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) represent a vast and rich intellectual tradition developed over millennia, encompassing diverse fields such as epistemology, engineering sciences, and the natural world. These systems provide profound insights into human understanding, nature, and the pursuit of knowledge. However, their value has often been undermined due to the dominance of European cultural experiences in shaping contemporary knowledge systems. This has led to the marginalization of IKS, discouraging young scholars from pursuing it as a field of inquiry. The limited work is frequently misunderstood, misrepresented, or relegated to the periphery, resulting in a significant intellectual loss for humanity. Without proper acknowledgment, the world continues to be deprived of this body of elegant literature capable of advancing theoretical and applied knowledge. <a href="/Conferencepage/about.html" class="learn-more">Learn More</a></p> </div>
        <div class="column"> <h2>A Resurgence in IKS and the Need for Decolonial Perspectives</h2> <p>As India‚Äôs global prominence grows, there has been a noticeable resurgence of interest in IKS, with scholars and practitioners striving to rediscover and engage with these knowledge systems. This renewed focus is welcome but comes with its challenges, particularly the tendency to force-fit IKS within dominant Western frameworks that do not fully capture its cultural essence or intellectual richness. The absence of an epistemic understanding rooted in India‚Äôs civilizational experiences further complicates this process. To ensure that this resurgence stays true to its purpose, it is imperative to adopt decolonial approaches that honor the integrity of IKS. By doing so, a robust body of knowledge can be built, offering the world innovative perspectives uniquely grounded in Indian traditions.</p> </div>
        <div class="column"> <h2>Vision and Goals of the Annual Academic Conference on IKS</h2> <p>The Annual Academic Conference on IKS aims to address these challenges by fostering serious academic engagement with Indian Knowledge Systems. It seeks to provide an international platform for the presentation and dissemination of cutting-edge research, building a community of scholars who share a passion for this field. The conference aspires to nurture the next generation of IKS researchers while celebrating the contributions of senior academics, thereby encouraging meaningful engagement with their work. Additionally, it aims to create opportunities for collaboration among stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and civil society. By promoting rigorous, peer-reviewed research and fostering diverse networks, the conference hopes to establish a solid intellectual foundation for IKS in the global academic landscape.</p> </div>
