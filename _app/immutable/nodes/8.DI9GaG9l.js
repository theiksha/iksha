Despite an increase in social science research, the quality of output and its contribution to understanding socio-economic processes are considered insufficient. The current discourse in humanities, social sciences, and discussions about Indian civilization often perpetuates Orientalist descriptions. There has been little progress in transitioning from the reproduction of European cultural experiences to a scientifically reflective examination of the Indian experience. The expansive domain of the Indian Knowledge System is currently labeled as a form of heritage or nationalistic sentiment, lacking significance or relevance. Furthermore, it is alleged to be treated as something regressive and contrary to progress.</p> <h5>Proposed Institutional Framework:</h5> <p>To overcome these challenges, a new institutional space is proposed, focusing on India with emphasis on Indian Knowledge System (IKS) (or any other name deemed appropriate). This initiative seeks to incubate young intellectual minds within selected institutions, fostering a scientific approach to the study of Indian civilization that aligns with Adhyatma.</p> <h5>Key Elements of the Proposal:</h5> <ol><li><strong>Comparative Approach:</strong> The study of Indian culture must adopt a comparative approach to understand and challenge Western-centric descriptions that have persisted for centuries.</li> <li><strong>Broad Program in IKS:</strong> A comprehensive program under the theme of Indian Civilizational Studies will cover diverse domains, including Comparative Law, Political Theory, Social Theory, Culture and Management, History, Comparative Religious Studies, Ethics, Psychology, Literature, Heritage Sciences, History of Indian Science and Technology, and the Dialogue between Indian and Contemporary Knowledge Systems, Public discourse etc.</li> <li><strong>Core Faculty and Students:</strong> The initiative will focus on facilitating PhD &amp; Post-doc programs with core faculty ranging from Assistant Professors to Professors, supported by identified scholars globally.</li> <li><strong>PhD Fellowship:</strong> Students shall be provided with a PhD fellowship for five years, matching recent UGC scales for JRF/SRF/RA.</li> <li><strong>PhD fellowship for the registered students:</strong> In this scheme the students who already have started their PhD work post course work will be selected and funded for the remaining years, wherein fellowship will be matchable to the level of UGC funding for the student.</li> <li><strong>Postdoctoral Fellowship:</strong> Students shall be provided with a post-doc fellowship for five years, matching recent government scholarships.</li> <li><strong>Selection Process:</strong> Selection of PhD and Postdoctoral students are strictly done by using a review process. The review process will involve identifying appropriate reviewers through the domain experts (similar to journal &amp; Conference) and generating a merit list and finally interviewing through a panel.</li> <li><strong>IKS Hubs:</strong> An attempt will also be made to establish at least 24 IKS hubs with robust funding support wherein at least 5 doctoral students around one broad research theme will work with multiple supervisors to ensure the required quality output. Each of this IKS hub is actually will emerge as Centre of Excellence in specific area in IKS.</li> <li><strong>Advisory and Monitoring Teams:</strong> An advisory team comprising eminent scholars will guide faculty and students, monitored by a committee to ensure the quality of research.</li> <li><strong>Annual Meetings:</strong> Scholars and supervisors will convene annually for idea exchange and collaboration.</li> <li><strong>Thesis to Book Conversion:</strong> Scholars will submit their PhD in the fourth year, followed by developing their theses into books within the subsequent year and a half.</li> <li><strong>Future Supervisors:</strong> Graduates of the program will become supervisors for future projects in the envisioned tradition.</li></ol> <h5>Implementation Strategy:</h5> <ol><li><strong>Incremental Expansion:</strong> Initiate the project with a limited number of supervisors and gradually expand the network annually.</li> <li><strong>Continuous Training and Dialogue:</strong> Establish forums for continuous training and dialogue among supervisors and an advisory team.</li> <li><strong>Central Coordination:</strong> A central body, structured as a Section-8 company, will coordinate activities, sign MOUs with institutions, and manage collaborations.</li> <li><strong>Resource Mobilization:</strong> Utilize resources from institutions like IITs, IIMs, and other public institutions to support the initiative.</li> <li><strong>Structured Funding:</strong> Develop plans for mobilizing funds and creating a structure to facilitate the initiative.</li></ol> <p>This proposal aims to liberate institutions from entrenched ideologies, fostering a new generation of scholars capable of producing knowledge rooted in Indian traditions. The strategic approach outlined here seeks to create a robust academic ecosystem that will yield a significant impact over the next 10-12 years, producing scholars who can contribute meaningfully to the academic landscape of India.</p>";return{c(){t=c("h1"),t.textContent=u,r=p(),n=c("div"),l=p(),i=c("div"),i.innerHTML=g,this.h()},l(e){t=d(e,"H1",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(t)!=="svelte-yb3g7s"&&(t.textContent=u),r=f(e),n=d(e,"DIV",{class:!0}),S(n).forEach(o),l=f(e),i=d(e,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(i)!=="svelte-6c3ftz"&&(i.innerHTML=g),this.h()},h(){y(n,"class","bordbot"),y(i,"class","width80 column rgap16 xx")},m(e,a){s(e,t,a),s(e,r,a),s(e,n,a),s(e,l,a),s(e,i,a)},p:h,i:h,o:h,d(e){e&&(o(t),o(r),o(n),o(l),o(i))}}}class x extends w{constructor(t){super(),b(this,t,null,T,I,{})}}export{x as component};
